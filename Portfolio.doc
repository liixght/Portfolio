Notes for Portfolio

Hi. I'm <span class="temi">Temi</span> — a Front-End Developer with a creative edge. I build responsive web interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and enhance them with visuals powered by tools like Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve. My workflow bridges clean code and sharp design — whether it's a smooth UI or standout motion graphics, I'm all about delivering polished, consistent results.
